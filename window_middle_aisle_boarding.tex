\begin{center}
  \Large Benefits of Outside-In Boarding
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimizes the need for seated passengers to stand up for others to access their seats
  \item Reduces overall boarding time compared to back-to-front approach (approximately 10 min vs. 12 min)
  \item Window seat passengers can settle while middle and aisle passengers prepare to board
  \item Reduces aisle congestion by distributing passengers throughout the aircraft
\end{itemize}

  \Large Comparison to Other Strategies

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5cm}|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Approx. Time} \\
  \hline
  Outside-In & Board by seat position (Window → Middle → Aisle) & 10 minutes \\
  Back-to-Front & Board by row from back to front & 12 minutes \\
  Hybrid Strategy & Combine position and row methods & 10 minutes \\
  Random & No organization & 22 minutes \\
