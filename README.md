# Aircraft Boarding Strategy Heatmaps

This repository contains LaTeX code for visualizing different aircraft boarding strategies using heatmaps. The code creates visual representations for each step of a boarding process for a Boeing 737-800 aircraft with rows 28-48 in economy class (6 seats per row in A-F configuration).

## Boarding Strategies

The following boarding strategies are visualized:

1. **Back-to-Front**: Passengers board in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front
2. **Outside-In (Window-Middle-Aisle)**: Passengers board based on seat position rather than row
3. **Hybrid Strategy**: Combination of back-to-front and outside-in strategies
4. **Random Boarding**: For comparison purposes

Each strategy's visualization shows how the aircraft fills step by step, with heatmaps highlighting the current boarding group.

## Files

- `group1_boarding.tex`: First boarding group (Rows 28-32)
- `group2_boarding.tex`: Second boarding group (Rows 33-37)
- `group3_boarding.tex`: Third boarding group (Rows 38-43)
- `group4_boarding.tex`: Fourth boarding group (Rows 44-48)

## Based on Research

This visualization is based on research from "Optimising Passenger Boarding in Aircraft Through a Mathematical Modeling" which analyzes different boarding strategies using mathematical models.
